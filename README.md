# D-B-PIC16B-Project
This is an interactive web app on tax and transfer system in U.S. with a focus on EITC both nationwide and by states.
We learn how to embed dash apps to flask from [this tutorial](https://hackersandslackers.com/plotly-dash-with-flask/).

# Tutorial

## Necessary packages

The following packages(not limited to them) probably need to be downloaded by using pip install (+package name):

1. ddtrace
2. python-dotenv
3. flask_assets
4. openpyxl
5. dash

## Run the website
We mainly use a flask structure of website, with dash part added in.

To run the website, first access the repository named **D-B-Webapp**, this is where our website is.

Then run the following command on Terminal if on mac:

*export FLASK_ENV=development*

*flask run*

# First draft questions:

1. Are there any function recommended to add to our webapp?
2. Should we include more text analysis to our webapp?
