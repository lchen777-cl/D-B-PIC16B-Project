The following packages(not limited to them) probably need to be downloaded by using pip install (+package name):

1. ddtrace
2. python-dotenv
3. flask_assets
4. dash

## Run the website
We mainly use a flask structure of website, with dash part added in.

To run the website, first access the repository named **D-B-Webapp**, this is where our website is.

Then run the following command on Terminal if on mac:

*export FLASK_ENV=development*

*flask run*

# First draft questions:

1. Are there any function recommended to add to our webapp?
2. Should we include more text analysis to our webapp?
